The term “t-test” refers to the fact that these hypothesis tests use t-values to evaluate your sample data. T-values are a type of test statistic. Hypothesis tests use the test statistic that is calculated from your sample to compare your sample to the null hypothesis. If the test statistic is extreme enough, this indicates that your data are so incompatible with the null hypothesis that you can reject the null.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Therapeutic Touch (TT) is the idea that everyone can feel the Human Energy Field (HEF) around individuals.  Those who practice TT have described different people's HEFs as \"warm as Jell-O\" and \"tactile as taffy.\" \n",
    "\n",

    "For her 4th grade science fair project, Emily decided to test whether or not TT practitioners could truly interact with a person's HEF. She later went on to publish her work in TT, becoming the youngest person to have a research paper published in a peer reviewed medical journal."

    "Emily's experiment was clean, simple, and effective. Due to her parents' occupations in the medical field, she had wide access to people who claimed to be TT practitioners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emily took 15 TT practitioners and used them for her science experiment. She would take a TT practitioner and ask them to extend their hands through a screen (which they can't see through). Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a pracitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answered correctly. She repeated this process 10 times for each practitioner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, through 150 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 70 times. These numbers were used to calculate the observed proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emily's main goal here was to test whether or not the TT practicioners' choices were better than random chance, like the flip of a coin. In most medical experiments, this is the norm. We want to test whether or not the treatment has an effect, *not* whether or not the treatment actually works. \n",
